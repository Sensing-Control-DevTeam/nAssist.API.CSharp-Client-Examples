# nAssist API: CSharp Client Examples

## Set up your Development Environment

nAssist API core relies on ServiceStack so the easiest way to get started is to use the autogenerated client.
First of all you will need to install ServiceStack's plugin for Visual Studio. You can get more detailed information on how to do that in the following link:

https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Install-ServiceStackVS

After you're done with the installing process you can just clone this repository on your chosen IDE and run the code!
